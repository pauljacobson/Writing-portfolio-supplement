## Background

I mentioned in a previous item that I (unsuccessfully) applied to Wix for a position in its marketing team. This item was one of the assignments I was given. I was asked to write the script for a hypothetical tutorial video explaining how to add full-width galleries to a Wix website.

I have retained Wix's name in this document because the assignment refers to specific Wix menu options and workflows.

| Bullet list: <ul><li>Horizontal photos work best</li><li>Upload higher resolution photos</li><li>Pick attention-grabbing scenes</li></ul> | Full width galleries work best with big, beautiful photos that will look great on your visitor's HD screen. Choose horizontal or landscape oriented photos because they will better fit most screens and don't be afraid to use high resolution images. You don't want your photos to look pixelated if they are supposed to be bold and sharp. |
