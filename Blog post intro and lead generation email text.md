## Background

This was an assignment from a company I applied to. The brief was in two parts:

1. Create a title and intro paragraph for a post on our blog. The topic should be around visual commerce.
2. Write an email that will be automatically sent 1 week after a site visitor downloads an ebook that will persuade the visitor to request a demonstration.

### Visual commerce transports your customers to their future life

When you are marketing a product, you are selling an experience to your customers. What better way to do that than to immerse them in your product? Go beyond generic product images and show them just how much your product will fit into their lives with rich images and videos.
