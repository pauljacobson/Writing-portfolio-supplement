## Writing Portfolio Supplement

The purpose of this repository is to showcase parts of my writing portfolio that are not published online and that I can't simply link to in [my main portfolio](http://pauljacobson.co/portfolio).

I have explained the background to each writing example at the beginning of each item. I have also replaced the name of the company concerned with a fictional name unless the brand name is necessary to make sense of the writing example.

This repo is a supplement to my main portfolio on [my professional profile site](http://pauljacobson.co).
