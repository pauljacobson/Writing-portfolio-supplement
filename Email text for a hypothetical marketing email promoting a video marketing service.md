## Background

I wrote this text as an assignment from a company I applied to for a position. The brief was to write copy for a marketing email promoting the company's promotional video solution.

I have replaced the company's name with "Acme".

## Email text

### With Acme videos, you could increase your click-through rate by 200%

Hi **First name**

Email remains a powerful marketing channel and yet marketers put up with mediocre results from their email campaigns.

According to MailChimp's "Email Marketing Benchmarks[^<https://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-benchmarks/>]", only about 21.93% of emails you send to your customers are opened. Out of those emails, the health and fitness industry's average click-through rate is only about 2.57%.

You can do better!
