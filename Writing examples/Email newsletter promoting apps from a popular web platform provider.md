About a billion people use Facebook Messenger every day. We certainly do and it's a terrific way to keep in touch with friends, family, and customers.

Too often it can be a hassle to connect with someone through a conventional website contact form.

Make it easy for visitors to connect with you. Add Facebook Messenger to your site with the [Live Messenger app from LUMIFISH Labs](https://www.wix.com/app-market/live-messenger/overview).

Live Messenger is easy to set up, integrates into your Facebook Page, and your fans and customers can start a conversation with you instantly. With this app, it's almost effortless for people to get in touch with you through your site.

What better way for your community to give you feedback than from your site using powerful commenting features? With [Comments from Uri Shaked](https://www.wix.com/app-market/comments/overview), building a vibrant community on your site couldn't be easier.

Also be sure to use the free mobile app so you can manage new feedback from your visitors while you are on the go.

Here's a great tip: Invite your audience to post testimonials with Comments. This is a powerful form of social proof that gives your site added credibility because the people posting them have first-hand experience with you.
