## Background

I wrote this text as part of an assignment for a company I applied to for a position in the marketing team. I was asked to write the opening paragraphs and a high-level outline for a hypothetical blog post titled "Turn Your Acme Video Into Compelling Facebook Ads That Convert".

I have replaced the company's name with "Acme".

## The text

When you are telling a story, video draws your audience in where you can inspire them to take action. Video is visceral, compelling and it is an engaging medium for your Facebook ads.

According to a [Nielsen study commissioned by Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/business/news/value-of-video), a consumer is as much as 74% more likely to make a purchase decision after watching a video on Facebook for just 10 seconds. It's no wonder we see such a proliferation of video content online, especially by smaller businesses looking for ways to make the biggest impact with more limited budgets.

Video is a remarkably flexible medium. Whether you want to boost brand awareness, inform prospective customers about the benefits of your solution or tip them over to a purchase decision, video ads can help you reach those goals by incorporating them into supercharged remarketing campaigns.
