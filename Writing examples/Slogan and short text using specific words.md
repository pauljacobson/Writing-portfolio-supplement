## Background

I applied for a marketing writer position at a marketing company. The assignment I received was in two parts:

1. Create a slogan using a series of hashtags
2. Use four words in a coherent sentence

## Text

### 1. Write slogan/post using these hashtags (one per hashtag):

1. #FOMO isn't a substitute for the real thing. Join Birthright Israel.  
2. Why #dreamhome when you can live it? Visit Israel with Taglit.
3. What's #betterthanbirthright? Make Aliyah and return home to Israel.

### 2. Put the following words into a paragraph (all of them in the same paragraph):

When you use our **platform** for more effective **audience** **targeting**, you're **showcasing** your best work to the people you most want to reach.
